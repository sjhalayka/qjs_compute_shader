The following code computes a quaternion Julia set by offloading the iterative function onto the graphics processing unit (GPU). This is done because the GPU has far more cores than a standard central processing unit (CPU), and can thus run more copies of the iterative function at once. This is accomplished by using an OpenGL compute shader. The output of the compute shader is then run through the Marching Cubes algorithm, which produces a set of triangles that defines the 2D surface of a quaternion Julia set. This triangle set is saved to STL format, which is widely supported (like, by MeshLab).
